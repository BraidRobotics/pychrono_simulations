<h1>Universal Analysis: All Experiment Series</h1>

<p>
    This page shows cross-cutting analysis that compares performance across <strong>all experiment types</strong>.
    For experiment-specific analysis, see <a href="/thickness_analysis">Thickness Analysis</a> or <a href="/layer_analysis">Layer Analysis</a>.
    All measurements are taken at <strong>10% height compression</strong> for consistent comparison.

    <h2>Structural Efficiency vs Weight</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Compares the structural efficiency of different designs by measuring how much force each can support relative to its own weight.<br>
        <strong>Calculation:</strong> Specific Load Capacity = Force at 10% compression / (Weight × g) where g = 9.81 m/s²<br>
        <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Higher values are better - they indicate the structure can support more load per unit of its own weight, meaning more efficient use of material. A value of 5.0 means the structure can support 5× its own weight.
