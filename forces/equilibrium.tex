\paragraph{Rationale for the Dual Criteria}

The equilibrium detection employs two distinct thresholds that serve complementary purposes. 

The maximum strain limit ($\varepsilon_{\text{target}}$) ensures the structure remains within its pre-buckling stage. For example, a structure at $8\%$ strain could be mechanically stable but exceeds the $5\%$ elastic limit, indicating plastic deformation.

The strain change limit ($\varepsilon_{\text{tol}}$) detects when the structure has stabilized and ceased significant motion. For example, a structure could experience low strain but be still oscillating and not in rest.
